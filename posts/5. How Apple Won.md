# How Apple Won (How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Fruit)
[Apple](https://apple.com) aka [APPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/) has recently taken over my computing world.
This didn't happen all at once, and I'm not particularly happy about it.
This post is my dive into why this has happened and what we can learn from it.

Note: I am by no means an apple fanboy.
I will gladly run the best platform out there.
The best platform is currently apple across nearly all of my devices.

## iPhone
The device I (and probably you) use most of all is the [cellular telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone).
Mine is an [iPhone 13](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-13) Mini in Midnight with their leather [MagSafe wallet](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM0Y3ZM/A/iphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-midnight) attached to the back.
I had previously been switching between iPhone and android for the last decade, but this was the first time I made a direct iPhone to iPhone switch.

One of the reasons is software longevity.
The iPhone works just as well 3 years in as it did on day one.
Whenever I get an Android, I am perfectly satisfied with it and find that the features are in many ways more advanced than the iPhone's, but am sorely disappointed with the device after a software update ruins it.
I'm not saying that Apple has never put out a stinker of an update, but it feels like with Android phones, they go out of their way to forget about paying customers after the sale has been completed.
This is not a consequence of continually going with one brand as I have used Google and Samsung's smaller flagship models, and have not heard much better from the likes of other companies.

Another reason is repairability.
There are phones out there like the [FairPhone](https://www.fairphone.com/en/), which offers a phone that can be repaired easily and is expected to last for 5 years, but I find the iPhone to be more repairable.
It's not because it is physically easier to open and replace parts, but because it's easier for me to go from broken phone to fixed phone.
Every repair shop fixes any iphone from the last few years within a couple of hours, and with Apple Care, I can go into any Apple Store and have my phone fixed or replaced.
This is not true of the competition.

The final reason is that it just works.
I tinker with all of my things, but the iPhone is one that I don't play with.
Maybe I've lost some of my tenacity for messing with things, but I really don't want to bother with Jailbreaking my Iphone to get an alternative app store that doesn't do anything.
Yes, it's anti-consumer that you are locked in the apple ways of doing things, but for a device that is required to "just work", it's probably much better that I don't tinker.
I realize that this reason for chosing Apple over Android is simply my own lack of self control combined with my own laziness, but this is my list, and you are free to write your own.
All I know is that if Android updates don't ruin my phone, I will.
This doesn't happen on my iPhones.
