# The importance of good audio in 2023
There has been something missing from this widescale transition to remote work/play and it's audio quality. 

Airpods are not good enough. Your laptop microphone is not good enough. You need a boom

## Why should I care?
In the ever-remote world of today, there are few ways to show your profesisonalism (beyond of course your work output). 
Gone are the days of banking executives showing their professional chops indirectly through the cut of their suit or the [font on their business card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cISYzA36-ZY). 
Now, the single way to prove you are someone worth doing business with is how easy you are to communicate with since you're not meeting in person. 
One aspect is replying to emails in a timely fashion (however you wish to define that). 
Another is actually being online when your slack/discord/teams/whatever says you are for quick answers.
The final (and I'm arguing most important) place is in virtual meetings. 
The most important thing is to be able to hear the people you are trying to communicate with and be heard by them. 
We, as a society are completely failing at this.

The most common headsets used by professionals that I interact with are 1. None, and 2. Apple airpods
