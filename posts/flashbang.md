I use darkmode. I'm not going to defend this choice.

Browsers and operating systems understand this.

You can make simple black and white websites understand this as well

```css

body {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}
@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
  }
}
```
I stole this code, and you can steal it too
