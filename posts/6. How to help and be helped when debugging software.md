# How to help and be helped when debugging software

N00bs and experienced programmers alike come across issues they simply cannot solve alone.
The following are a few things that I've noticed are important when trying to tackle a problem with another person.

## Discover the details in the moment

The helper should not allow their mind to be influenced by the ideas of the person being helped. 
The person being helped should give a high level overview of the problem and allow the helper to re-discover the steps that have been taken to debug the issue. 
Many times, a problem is solved because the person helping goes over an aspect of the prgram that the person needing help has "already checked 1000 times."
If the person being helping is given too much information, they will start to fall into the same traps that the person needing the help already has.
In addition, the person being helped shouldn't give simple answers to questions about the state of the application, but should prove them. 
For example: Don't say that the variable in question has been initialized, but prove it's been initialized by printing it's fields.

## The Person helping should be in charge

The person needing assistance needs to be mindful of the time and effort of the person helping by allowing them to take charge. 
This ties into the above point in that if the person being helped is leading the person helping, they will continue to fall into the same holes they have been, and gain no benefit from the person helping.

## Priors must be confirmed

Any non-trivial program relies on a large number of things going on behind the scenes before you even get close to the aspect being worked on.
Many of the problems I help with come down to the person being helped having an incomplete view of the prerequisites of their solution. 
The helper should not take the helpee's word that the necessary prerequisites are in place. 
Both people should build up a mental tree of dependencies and go one-by-one confirming them. 
The person requiring help is in too deep with their issue to consider doing this much of the time, or they may have missed a step in doing so.

## Focus must be maintained

Do not allow the conversation or the debugging process to go off the rails.
More often than not, a diversion from the process will lead to more issues cropping up, and goodwill being wasted.
If the person being helped comes up with an idea radically different from the one currently being attempted, they should write it down and suggest it to the helper once the current avenue has ben exhausted.

## Do not allow the state of the non-working code to be polluted

When trying to fix things, there are always going to be a few things that get added or removed in each stage in the process.
When it turns out that those additions or removals didn't solve the problem, make sure to **get rid of them**.
Polluting the state of the current problem leads to more complex problems popping up.
