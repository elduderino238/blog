# My Career Path So Far
A lot of people keep asking how I got into software. The basics of it are that I started learning one day, and kept learning and trying new things and finding myself in new situations.
I am writing this up to show people trying to get into software development that everything doesn't follow a set path, and that there are many ways to get where you are going.
I will periodically come back and update this page as my career progresses.
There are some things I'm leaving out for various reasons.

## Elementary School
My first time using a computer outside of the ordinary was in elementary school. 
I installed the [cheat engine](https://cheatengine.org/), and promptly started using it to cheat in online flash games.
The cheat I remember most fondly was on the game [Motherload](https://www.crazygames.com/game/motherload). 
I was bad at it, so I used cheat engine to give myself infiinte money to beat it easier. 
Another foray into interesting computer usage was downloading one of those 2d game creator programs and promply getting bored and never trying again.
Near the end of 6th grade (if I recall correctly), I installed Linux for the first time.
I didn't do anything beyond basic desktop usage and web browsing, but the linux environment would eventually change the trajectory of my entire life.
This experience opened my eyes to some of the possibilities of Open Source Software, and would become a major part of my life when I got into College.

## High School
In High School, I took a couple of [PLTW](https://www.pltw.org/) classes. 
One was on digital electronics, where we learned how to build circuits and how logic gates worked.
The one I enjoyed most, however, was one where we built various contraptions and programmed them in Arduino C.
I really took to the Arduino stuff and got my first real programming experience by being more-or-less the dedicated programming person in my class.
I continued programming and working with circuits on my own after my brother bought me an arduino of my own. 
I never really built anything of note, but I always imagined myself eventually starting a company building consumer electronics (I still do...).

## College
I attended [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) and decided to study [Business Economics](https://www.econ.iastate.edu/business-economics).
I briefly picked up a second major in Computer Science, but I dropped that when I realized what a hassle it was and I egotistically assumed I would be able to learn enough on my own (hah, I was right!).
I also picked up a student job at the [IT Solution Center](https://www.it.iastate.edu/help/).

### Formal Education

I took the following classes relevant to my software career

-------------------
| Class | Class Title | Grade | Impact |
|-------|-------------|-------|--------|
| COM S 227 | Introduciton to Object Oriented Programming | C | This was the only actual Computer Science class I ever completed. I discovered how much I disliked writing in a slow and laggy IDE. I got such a low grade because I didn't do most of the homework. I found that the class moved too slow and that I was learning much more following random tutorials and things on the web than I was sitting in class.|
| COM S 228 | Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms | Dropped | This class was the final straw on my academic learning of Computer Science. The class was too slow, and it took too much time to do my homework and labs, so I decided to drop the Computer Science second major and the class along with it.|
| DS    201 | Introduction to Data Science | B | This class was taught in python, and I had tried my best to sneak my way into the intermediate class given my python knowledge at this point (explained in the informal education section) and the sheer amount of Statistics classes I had taken at that point. I had a great time working with my classmates, but ultimately learned very little.|
| ECON  431 | Managerial Economics | A- | This is where I probably learned the most about writing software. The final project was doing some statistical analysis on some data with a group, and I was hell-bent on flexing my new programming skills. Ultimately I came up with the solution to the problem using my [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and it was not the one ultimately used by the group. This was a much more valuable lesson than anything I learned in another classroom. Learning to work in a group and handle disagreements are things that I still learn more about to this day. I also learned that technical supremacy isn't everything. Good tech is useless if you can't convince anyone else to use it.|

### Informal Education

Near the end of my freshman year, I got a job at the [IT Solution Center](https://www.it.iastate.edu/help/) where I met a handful of very competent programmers who helped me along my journey.
The single biggest impact was had by a friend of mine that I met working, [Sean Hinchee](https://seh.dev).
He gave me a lot of resources and plenty of good (and some weird) advice.
He introduced me to so many concepts and projects including, but not limited to [plan9](https://plan9.io/plan9/), [vim](https://www.vim.org/), [go](https://go.dev/), [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), and [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com).
One weekend shift, I had just bought a [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.com/), and was having trouble installing ano operating system on it.
Sean looked at it for a little bit and promptly loaded up the basic version of Raspbian on it, plugged it into a monitor in the Solution Center, and booted into the terminal environment.
He ran the single command `man man` and told me to get started there.

That was the moment that I realized I had no idea what I was doing and that I NEEDED to learn everything about this sytem. 
Over the next few years, I went whole-hog into the Linux system. 
I installed [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) on my main computer, and started doing everything in Linux.
Any problem was something I could solve using google searches and some basic understanding of the system, and eventually, any problem was something I could solve by coding it up myself.
I figured I ought to master a programming language and started learning python. 
While I was learning python and digging into Linux, I was also trying to upgrade the experience at work.

I realized that the board we kept on the wall to keep track of call volume and tickets was just a [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) board that was backed by some sql statements run against a couple of databases.
I made it my life's mission (at least while at work) to make this board as good as possible. 
This initiative, combined with my burgeoning python experience lead to me being sniped by a manager who had moved to the Network Engineering team.
My job at Network Engineering was writing python scripts to automate network administration.
Working professionally, my code quality and quantity increased exponentially over the year or so that I worked there.
I became confident in my programming skills, and branched out into the basics of pretty much every language I could get my hands on.

## Out of College
### Real Estate Mangement Internship
I guess technically while still in college, I did an internship for a Real Estate Management company in Atlanta one summer.
I wrote code to gather information on the local market, and learned how to use [GIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview).
GIS isn't really relevant to this story, but I really enjoyed the cartography I did during that summer.

### Home Depot Marketing Department
When I graduated, I was able to find a contract position working in a marketing department of Home Depot.
My team was in charge of moving items around on the website, and some information was easiest to get by looking at it directly on the website.
The person in charge of it was eventually promoted off to another team, and needed to be backfilled.
My job was to write web-scrapers for my team and provide the data to them when needed.
I was cool with the first part of the work, but the "keep in constant contact with people" part was annoying after a while.
I decided to write the [Script Portal](https://github.com/HomeDepot/ScriptPortal). 
It allowed me to take these python scripts and put them on a server (actually a second work laptop that I was able to use), and let my colleagues handle running them thrugh a UI that I coded up.
A reorganization happened, and my job was cut, so I had to find a new position.
I found one that sounded interesting and applied internally so I eneded up at the CD team.

### Home Depot CD Team
Here, I was on a team tasked with taking [Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.io/) and making it suitable for Home Depot use.
I learned a ton about [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and got good at writing go services.
Throughout my time, I learned how to use GitHub actions, how to write production ready code, and most importantly, how to work on a full development team.
Eventually, I decided to move on, and found a job at GridPlus.

### GridPlus
I currently work at [GridPlus](https://gridPlus.io) and develop for the [Phonon](https://phonon.network) project.
My job is on the team writing the [Phonon Client](https://github.com/GridPlus/phonon-client] application and associated [core library](https://github.com/phononDao/phonon-core).
Over time, I've become more of a technical lead on the project, partly responsible for the definition of the phonon spec, and leading the devlopment of the desktop client.
I am also responsible for much of the external communication to the greater community.
